Theorem (Factorial)
Given (x)
Proof
	suppose (x <= 1) perfomed 
	therefore proven 1;
	proven x * Factorial(x - 1); 
QED

Theorem (pow)
Given (x y)
Proof
	suppose (y == 0) perfomed
	therefore proven 1;

	mulx = x;
	Consider {
		x = x * mulx; 
		y = y - 1;
	} assuming expression (y >= 2) perfomed;
	proven x;
QED

Theorem (sin)
Given (x)
Proof
	result   = 0;
	currTerm = 0;
	minus    = 0;

	Consider {
		currVal = pow(x currTerm * 2 + 1);
		Conclusion(currVal);
		currVal = currVal / Factorial(2 * currTerm + 1);
		suppose (minus == 1) perfomed
		therefore {
			result = result - currVal;
			minus = 0;
		} however {
			result = result + currVal;	
			minus = 1;
		}
		currTerm = currTerm + 1;
	} assuming expression (currTerm <= 10) perfomed;
	proven result;
QED

y = 0;
