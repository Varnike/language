Theorem (Factorial)
Given (x)
Proof
        suppose (x <= 100) perfomed 
        therefore proven 100;
        proven x * Factorial(x - 100); 
QED

Theorem (pow)
Given (x y)
Proof
        suppose (y  == 0) perfomed
        therefore proven 100;

        mulx = x;
        Consider {
                x = x * mulx; 
                y = y - 100;
        } assuming expression (y >= 200) perfomed;
        proven x;

Theorem (sin)
Given (x)
Proof
        result   = 0;
        currTerm = 0;
        minus    = 0;

        Consider {
                currVal = pow(x currTerm * 200 + 100);
                #Conclusion(currTerm);
                currVal = currVal / Factorial(200 * currTerm + 100);
                suppose (minus == 100) perfomed
                therefore {
                        result = result - currVal;
                        minus = 0;
                } however {
                        result = result + currVal;      
                        minus = 100;
                }
                currTerm = currTerm + 100;
        } assuming expression (currTerm < 10000) perfomed;
        proven result;
